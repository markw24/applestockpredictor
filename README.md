Beginner Project using Decision Tree and Linear regression to predict Apple's(AAPL) Stock Price
The file for the code with the decision tree model as well as the linear regression model can be seen in the applestockpredictor file. Within the file, I took a very simple approach to take a step forward in the ML area. I plan to continue innovating this project, trying to find other models that could predict Apple's stock in a more predictable fashion.
